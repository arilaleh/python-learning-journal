The parts that were easy for me included defining variables and using simple print statements, as I’m comfortable with basic Python syntax. However, I found it challenging to manipulate strings, particularly when formatting strings to include the values of variables without explicitly stating what they are, and using one print statement to print variables on their own lines.\n",

        "A specific challenge I faced was removing the substring \"first\" from the string \"This is my first string.\" The concepts we covered in class didn't directly address this task, so I wasn't initially sure how to approach it. Fortunately, I am also taking a foundations of data science course where I recently learned about the slicing method. I applied this knowledge by using slicing to manually remove \"first\" by selecting the parts of the string before and after the substring, then concatenating them to form the final result. This experience taught me the value of integrating concepts from different courses to solve problems, and it reinforced the usefulness of slicing for string manipulation.\n",
