Hi, I'm Ariana Lalehparvar, a data science major at West Valley College. I'm passionate about uncovering insights from data and using those insights to solve real-world problems. Although I'm new to programming, I'm excited to learn Python and see how it can be applied in data science.
# Goals for This Course
1. Learn the fundamentals of Python programming
2. Build a strong foundation in Python that will support my future studies in data science.
3. Strengthen my problem-solving and critical-thinking skills
# My First Python Program
